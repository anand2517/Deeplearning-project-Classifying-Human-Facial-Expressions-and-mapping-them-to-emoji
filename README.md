# Mini_Project -Deeplearning-project-Classifying-Human-Facial-Expressions-and-mapping-them-to-emoji

Deep learning is a very popular method for facial expression recognition and classification. In
that we have used Convolutional neural networks (CNN) for facial expression recognition and
classification.For that we have built convolutional neural networks architecture and trained
the model on [FER(2013)](https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013) dataset for Emotion recognition and classification. After classifying the
input data we have maped it to the corresponding emoji.
